TAU 2014 Contest: Common Path Pessimism Removal (CPPR)
https://sites.google.com/site/taucontest2014/
 
With the increasing number and significance of manufacturing and environmental sources of variability 
in the design and use of modern VLSI designs, timing analysis tools must somehow model and account for uncertainty. 
The predominant approach is to create early and late bounds, where each signal's delay is bounded by a lower- 
and upper-bound. However, this early/late timing split can cause the analysis to be artificially pessimistic, 
thereby leading to unnecessary increases for design turnaround time and cost. This contest will focus on 
removing this artificially-introduced pessimism in the fastest amount of time possible.
